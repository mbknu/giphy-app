2. Then you have to install the dependencies by typing in your terminal :

3. You will need to create an api key [here](https://support.giphy.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020283431-Request-A-GIPHY-API-Key) to get access to the API from [GIPHY](https://giphy.com/)

4. Once you have the key, create `.env` file in the root of the project, you should have this :
